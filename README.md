# README

This project contains code and data for an assignment about stochastic simulations of flooding.

## Files and folders

- `flooding.py` — Main code for flooding simulations
- `flooding_plots.py` — Plot functions and visualizations
- `markov_state.py` — Markov model implementation
- `normal_implementation.py` — Standard (non-SDE) implementation
- `sde_levy.py` — SDE/Levy process implementation
- `modules/assignment3.py` — Extra functions and logic for the assignment
- `data/` — Contains numpy data files (`max_queues.npy` - Levy , `min_queues.npy` - Levy, other ones are Markov). 
- `images/` — For saving images/plots

Markov_state, sde_levy and normal all make plots

## TODO

Make hypothesis testing (mira). Maybe do a test or anhilated pairing is significant different in std dev? Or importance sampleing? 

Max makes maths and problem statements
